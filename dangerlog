1.message accept and resend.
we use a dict(key: seq, value: sent message) to record the the info we send. once we recv ack,
we will pop it out. otherwise we will resend the message each 1s

we use a set to record the info we receive. we only proceed the info not in set, then we will 
its seq into the set

2.multi-thread
we use 2 thread in communication part(i.e. ups & world)
1 thread for recv info
1 thread for resend info
since python data structure is thread safe, we think we prevent the racing completely

3.good oo design
we use base class for communication, and reduce redundancy, making it less to make mistakes
ups & world inherit from base, the base is for decode & encode

4.input validation
after each user input, we check the correctness and availability.
Invalid inputs will be rejected and user will be notified

5.user identification
not user will be able to access our website or mess with our data.
High level of security ensured
